  description: My work focuses on understanding "Cosmic Dawn" -- when and how did the first galaxies form, what are their connections with the dark matter halos they form in, and how was intergalactic hydrogen reionized? Outside of work I try to spend as much of my time as possible away from a computer, usually in or on water (mostly swimming and rowing).
