  description: My work focuses on understanding "Cosmic Dawn" -- when and how did the first galaxies form, what are their connections with the dark matter halos they form in, and how was intergalactic hydrogen reionized? Outside of work I try to spend as much of my time as possible away from a computer, usually in or on water (mostly swimming and rowing).

She is now a DAWN Fellow co-supervising Gonzalo, and is interested in understanding the properties of early galaxies. Outside of work, she enjoys many forms of movement, including biking, climbing, and running.

  description: My work focuses on understanding the Epoch of Reionisation with theoretical models and simulations - what was the nature of the first galaxies emerging in our Universe, and how did they evolve? What were their footprints in the ionisation state of the intergalactic hydrogen gas?
