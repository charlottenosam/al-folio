The universe underwent a phase transition from predominantly neutral at recombination (z ∼ 1100), to almost fully ionized by z ∼ 6. We have not identified the sources of ionizing photons – though the most likely candidates are young stars in galaxies. Lyman alpha emission from star-forming galaxies is absorbed by neutral gas, so observations of Lyα in high-z galaxies can constrain the timeline and morpology of reionization. I have developed a new Bayesian framework for directly inferring the neutral hydrogen fraction in the IGM from Lyα observations. I led the design, reduction and analysis of a ESO VLT Large Program with KMOS (PI: A Fontana) to measure the reionization timeline from upper limits of Lyα emission at z > 7.5.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
